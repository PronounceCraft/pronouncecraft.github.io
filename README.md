## üß† Model

Kokoro Web is powered by [hexgrad/Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M), an open-weight 82 million parameter Text-to-Speech model available on Hugging Face.

> Despite its lightweight architecture, it delivers comparable quality to larger models while being significantly faster and more cost-efficient. With Apache-licensed weights, Kokoro can be deployed anywhere from production environments to personal projects.

This is one of the top-ranked models in [TTS Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TTS-AGI/TTS-Arena), just behind ElevenLabs.

Special thanks to the model creators for making this technology accessible.

## üöÄ Usage

### Option 1: Use it online

Visit the hosted version at [voice-generator.pages.dev](https://voice-generator.pages.dev) and start generating voices instantly!

### Option 2: Self-host with Docker

The self-hosted version includes an OpenAI-compatible API that works as a drop-in replacement for applications using [OpenAI's text-to-speech API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech).

```yaml
services:
  kokoro-web:
    image: ghcr.io/eduardolat/kokoro-web:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - KW_SECRET_API_KEY=your-api-key
    volumes:
      - ./kokoro-cache:/kokoro/cache  # Cache downloaded models and voices
    restart: unless-stopped
```

You can adjust the `compose.yaml` according to your needs or use docker run directly.

Then access the web UI at http://localhost:3000 and the API at http://localhost:3000/api/v1/index.html

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment variables

- **KW_SECRET_API_KEY** - Your API key for authentication. If left blank, authentication will not be activated

- **KW_PUBLIC_NO_TRACK** - Opt out of anonymous usage analytics

## üîå API Integration

Kokoro Web provides an OpenAI-compatible API that works as a drop-in replacement for applications using OpenAI's text-to-speech service:

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'http://your-kokoro-host/api/v1',
  apiKey: 'your-kokoro-api-key',
});
const speechFile = path.resolve("./speech.mp3");

const mp3 = await openai.audio.speech.create({
  model: "model_q8f16",
  voice: "af_heart",
  input: "Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
});

const buffer = Buffer.from(await mp3.arrayBuffer());
await fs.promises.writeFile(speechFile, buffer);
```
